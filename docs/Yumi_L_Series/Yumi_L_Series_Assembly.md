## 1.4.3 Belt Tension Adjustment

Proper belt tension is important for accurate engraving and cutting.  

**Steps:**
1. Locate the X and Y axis belts.  
2. With the machine powered off, gently press each belt at the midpoint.  
   - They should feel firm, with about 3â€“4 mm of deflection when pressed.  
3. If a belt is too loose or too tight, adjust using the belt tensioners on the frame.  
4. Make sure both sides are equally tensioned to avoid skewed movements.  
5. Re-check after a few hours of operation, as new belts may stretch slightly.  

 A belt that is too loose can cause **layer**, while a belt that is too tight may cause **excessive wear on motors and pulleys**.
