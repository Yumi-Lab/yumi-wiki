# ❤️ Open Source at Heart — Powered by Klipper ❤️

Before going further, let’s take a moment to acknowledge Kevin O'Connor — the brilliant mind behind Klipper.
His firmware redefined 3D printing by shifting complex calculations from the printer’s mainboard to an external system, unlocking greater speed, precision, and quality.

Klipper thrives as a community-driven, open-source project — and at YUMI, we proudly embraced this vision: open, modular, and built for performance.
Our mission is clear: make multicolor 3D printing fast, reliable, and accessible to all.

We are launching this project with you, our contributors, in mind. Join us in this exciting adventure — and together, let's revolutionize open-source 3D printing.

# 🖨️ YUMI C Series — The Multicolor 3D Printer, Reimagined

The YUMI Model C is a next-generation 3D printer built for speed, precision, and true multicolor performance — without compromise.

Powered by Klipper firmware, it combines ultra-fast motion control (up to 700 mm/s) with modular extrusion options: choose between the ChromaX12 head for up to 12 independent colors, or the high-temperature DirectDrive for faster printing with flexible and technical materials.

Every detail was designed to solve the pain points of multicolor printing:
✅ No purge towers
✅ Minimal waste
✅ Fast color switching
✅ Clean filament transitions
✅ AI-assisted monitoring
✅ Remote control via the YUMI | lab app

Available in three build volumes (C235 / C335 / C435), the YUMI Model C adapts to every workspace — from your home studio to a professional lab.

Whether you're an artist, educator, or engineer, the YUMI Model C is not just a printer. It's a platform for creative freedom.

📏 Three Build Sizes
Choose from C235 / C335 / C435, covering needs from everyday prints to large-scale projects.
→ From compact to professional-scale prints.

# 🌟 MAIN FEATURES — The Future of Modular 3D Printing

## 🚀 Ultra-Fast & High-Performance Printing
Print at up to 700 mm/s with accelerations up to 20,000 mm/s². The 220V/110V heated bed reaches 100°C in seconds, so your prints start like never before

## 🎨 Modular Multi-Color System (1 to 12 Colors)
The YUMI Material System (YMS) scales from 1 to 12 independent modules.
Each YMS includes an anti-UV protective cover, and only 10 cm of retraction is needed to switch colors.
Filament is cut close to the nozzle, reducing purge, and waste is automatically ejected.

# 🎯 YMS — The Modular Material System That Changes Everything

<p align="center">
  <img src="/img/YumiCSeries/YumiCSeries010.avif" alt="yumiC" />
</p>


At the heart of the YUMI Model C lies our most revolutionary innovation: the YMS (YUMI Material System) — a fully modular, independent multicolor filament system designed to make multi-material 3D printing simple, fast, and clean.

Each YMS module handles one filament spool, and the system scales from 1 up to 12 colors, depending on your needs. Whether you want to print with just a few shades or create full-color artistic models, you decide how far you go — and you can upgrade anytime.
But it’s not just about color. YMS is built for performance and reliability:

– 🧠 Independent filament routing means no tangling, no waiting, and no switching delays
– ✂️ Filament is cut directly near the nozzle, not up in the heatsink — reducing waste, retraction time, and purging
– 🧼 Only 10 cm of retraction is needed to switch colors, and purged material is automatically ejected
– 🔒 All YMS modules include an anti-UV cover, protecting your filaments from light degradation
– 🔥 The YMS PRO version goes further, with an integrated chamber that heats up to 85°C, using a 360° internal airflow system — ideal for technical and sensitive materials

Whether you’re printing prototypes, figurines, or detailed functional parts, YMS lets you switch colors like never before — with speed, control, and elegance.

No more towers. No more waste. Just pure color freedom.

## 🔊 Vibration Compensation & Pressure Advance
Includes a built-in ADXL sensor for Input Shaper, and native support for Pressure Advance.
→ Your prints come out faster, cleaner, and sharper — especially on corners and curve.

## 📡 Non-Contact Metal-Based Auto Bed Leveling
→ Result: perfect first layers and high dimensional accuracy.
YUMI uses a proximity sensor to detect the build surface without any physical contact, unlike systems that require the nozzle to press directly onto the plate.
→ This ensures consistent precision, even in the presence of dust, residue, or fragile build surfaces.
