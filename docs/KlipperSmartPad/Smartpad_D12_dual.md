## With purge system


The advantage of the purge system is that the filament is loaded automatically. If the purge profile is used each time, the filament is loaded and unloaded at the correct level and no preparatory action is required.

### Profile Klipper

Remember to use the latest dual version of the klipper profile.

For the moment the following motherboards are configured:

- 3.2


### Purge system


You must have printed the purge system

STL:

To fit, remove the 2 screws from the X axis on the right, install the bleed system and replace the 2 screws.

To clean the nozzle, use silicone sheeting(1) which you stick in the space provided and use aluminium tape(2) to help the drain down.

### Orcaslicer

Also use orcaslicer profiles for the D12 DUAL.

Import profile

Add the profile for the wanhao d12 300 to the predefined printers. then download the profile for your printer and import it. there's a version with bltouch (bl in name) and one without (no bl in name).

It's an optimized profile. As a reminder, you need to adapt the profile to your 3d models.

Adjust the rinse volume to avoid having too large a purge tower.

![Dualcolororca](/img/KlipperSmartPad/DualColorD12/profildualorcaslicer003.png)


For fairly dark colours use between 0.35 and 0.45
For darker colours, use between 0.55 and 0.65
For light colours use between 0.35 and 0.45

These are only guidelines. You need to find the right purge for your colours.

You can now cut and test Dual Color.
