## Prerequisites:
- **Smart Pi One**: Ensure your Smart Pi One is powered on and has a Wi-Fi module or [dongle](https://wanhao-europe.com/collections/yumi-accessoires-diy/products/cle-wifi-compaitble-windows-linux-2-4g) connected.
- **NetworkManager and `nmcli`**: These should be installed by default on most Linux distributions for Smart Pi One. If not, install them using your package manager.

## Steps: 

**1. Open a Terminal**:
   Access the terminal on your Smart Pi One. You can do this directly if you have a monitor and keyboard connected, or via SSH if your Smart Pi One is already on the network.

**2. Check if NetworkManager is Running**:
   Ensure that NetworkManager is running. Start it if necessary:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl start NetworkManager
   sudo systemctl enable NetworkManager
   ```

**3. Check Wi-Fi Device Status**:
   List all network devices to find your Wi-Fi device:
   ```bash
   nmcli device status
   ```
   Look for your Wi-Fi device, which should be listed as **`wifi`** type (e.g., **`wlan0`**).

**4. Turn On the Wi-Fi Device**:
   If your Wi-Fi is off, turn it on using:
   ```bash
   nmcli radio wifi on
   ```

**5. List Available Wi-Fi Networks**:
   Scan for available Wi-Fi networks:
   ```bash
   nmcli device wifi list
   ```
   This command lists all visible Wi-Fi networks. If this command runs indefinitely, for stop it by pressing **`Ctrl + C`**.

**6. Connect to a Wi-Fi Network**:
   Use the following command to connect to your desired Wi-Fi network. Replace **`YOUR_SSID`** with the network name and **`YOUR_PASSWORD`** with the Wi-Fi password:
   ```bash
   nmcli device wifi connect YOUR_SSID password YOUR_PASSWORD
   ```

**7. Verify the Connection**:
   Ensure your Smart Pi One is connected to the Wi-Fi network:
   ```bash
   nmcli connection show --active
   ```
   for stop it by pressing **`Ctrl + C`**.


## Identify the Wi-Fi IP Address:
   The output of the **`hostname -I`** command might include multiple IP addresses if you have more than one network interface (e.g., Ethernet, Wi-Fi, VPNs, Docker interfaces). You will need to identify which one is the IP address of your Wi-Fi connection.
   ```bash
   $ hostname -I
   192.168.1.2 172.17.0.1
   ```
