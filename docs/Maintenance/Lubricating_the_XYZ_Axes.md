## ⚙️ Required Tools & Materials

## 🧼 Preparation Steps

1. **Turn off** the printer and **unplug** it.
2. **Manually move** the printhead and bed to access all rails and screws.
3. Use a cloth to **clean old grease, dust, or debris** from all mechanical parts.

## 🛢️ Lubricating the X/Y Axes (Linear Rails)

The X and Y axes move along **linear guide rails** with internal ball bearings.

### Instructions

1. Apply **1–2 drops** of light oil directly on each rail.
2. **Manually move** the printhead and gantry across all directions to distribute the oil.
3. Wipe away any **excess oil**.

!!! warning "Don't Use Grease"
    Never use grease on X/Y rails. It attracts dust and can clog the internal bearings.

## ⚙️ Lubricating the Z Axis (Lead Screw)

The Z axis uses a **lead screw** that lifts the build plate vertically.

### Instructions

1. Locate the **lead screw(s)**.
2. Apply a **thin layer of grease** with a swab or brush.
3. Move the bed up/down manually or via the printer menu to spread the grease.

!!! note
    If old grease is dark or sticky, clean it off before applying fresh grease.

## ✅ Final Tips

- Use **only compatible lubricants** for plastic and metal parts.
- **Don't over-lubricate** — excess can attract dust.
- Avoid products like **WD-40**, which are solvents, not lubricants.
