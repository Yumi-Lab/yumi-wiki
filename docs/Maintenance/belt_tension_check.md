## 🔧 Check Procedure

1. **Power off** the printer.
2. **Gently press** the center of the belt — it should have some resistance but not feel loose.
3. Alternatively, pluck the belt like a string:
   - A firm "twang" sound indicates good tension.
   - A dull or floppy feel means adjustment is needed.

## ⚖️ Adjustment (if applicable)

- Locate tension screws on the X and Y axis carriages or idler mounts.
- Tighten gradually and test often.
- Avoid overtightening.

## 📅 Final Notes

- If you hear grinding or skipping during prints, check belts immediately.
- Inspect pulley set screws for tightness as well.
