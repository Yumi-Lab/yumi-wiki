# 🧼 Nozzle Cleaning – Maintenance Guide

---

## 🎯 Objective

This guide explains how to **clean the nozzle of a 3D printer** effectively to ensure smooth extrusion and avoid partial or complete clogs.

⚙️ **Important:** These instructions apply only to printers equipped with an extruder that includes a **manual release mechanism** for separating the drive gears (such as a lever).

---

## 🛠️ Required Tools

- Flat wrench suitable for the nozzle (typically 7 mm)
- Brass wire brush (recommended)
- Cleaning needle or thin wire (0.35–0.4 mm)
- Tweezers or pliers
- Clean cloth
- Heat-resistant gloves (optional)
- Cleaning filament or standard filament (e.g. PLA or PETG)

---

## ⚠️ Safety Precautions

!!! warning
    - **Release the extruder manually** using the provided lever or system before inserting or removing filament.
    - Perform cleaning only when the nozzle is **at operating temperature**.
    - Never touch the hot nozzle with bare hands: **burn hazard**.
    - Unplug the printer if you need to disassemble any part.

## 🧽 Cleaning Steps

### 1. Heat the Nozzle (via Mainsail / Klipper)

- Open **Mainsail** (your Klipper web interface).
- Set the nozzle temperature to the working temperature of the loaded filament (e.g. 200°C for PLA).
- This will soften any internal residue, making it easier to clean.

---

### 2. External Cleaning

- Use a **brass wire brush** to clean off visible debris and burnt filament around the nozzle.
- Do **not** use steel brushes, as they may damage the nozzle coating.

---

### 3. Internal Cleaning (Needle or Cleaning Wire)

- Carefully insert a **cleaning needle** or thin wire into the nozzle tip while it’s hot.
- Gently push and move the wire to dislodge any melted or partially carbonized material.

---

### 4. Cold Pull Method

1. Load **cleaning filament** (or PLA) into the hotend.
2. Heat the nozzle to ~200°C using Mainsail.
3. Manually extrude some filament until it flows through the nozzle.
4. Lower the temperature to about **90°C** and wait until it stabilizes.
5. Firmly pull out the filament manually. Residue inside the nozzle should come out stuck to it.
6. Repeat this process 2–3 times if necessary, trimming the filament tip between each pull.

!!! tip
    If the filament breaks during removal, heat up to ~100°C and try again.

### 5. Extrusion Test

- Load clean filament.
- Extrude 5 to 10 cm at working temperature using Mainsail.
- The extrusion should be **smooth and continuous**, with no bubbles or inconsistencies.

## 🔄 Recommended Cleaning Frequency

| Printer Usage     | Suggested Cleaning Interval   |
|-------------------|-------------------------------|
| Occasional        | Every 2 months               |
| Regular           | Once per month                |
| Intensive (daily) | Every 2 weeks               |

## ✅ Additional Tips

- Always use **high-quality filament from the Yumi brand** to reduce clog risks.
- Do not leave heated filament idle in the nozzle for long periods.
- If issues persist after cleaning, consider **replacing the nozzle**.
